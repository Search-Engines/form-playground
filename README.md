# Solid Form Playground

See it [live on github pages](https://solid.github.io/form-playground/playground.html)

Play with solid forms. Apply a random form to a random object.

Todo: Create and edit forms, and associate forms with types.

Possiblefuture directions:

- Try out a given form in real time on an arbitrary subject
- Fork, and edit, forms
- Build simple apps using just a form or two: user level programming
- Drill though to underlying shapes
- Drill though to underlying ontology (schema)
- Analyze, visualize ontology
- Collaboratively edit ontology
- Allow one to be able to accumulate a bunch of resources into a project as a first class object
