# Solid Form Playground

See the [form playground live on github pages](https://solid.github.io/form-playground/playground.html)

Play with solid forms. Apply a random form to a random object.

Todo: Create and edit forms, and associate forms with types.

Possible future directions:

- Try out a given form in real time on an arbitrary subject
- Fork, and edit, forms
- Build simple apps using just a form or two: user level programming
- Drill though to underlying shapes
- Drill though to underlying ontology (schema)
- Analyze, visualize ontology
- Collaboratively edit ontology
- Allow one to be able to accumulate a bunch of resources into a project as a first class object

## Simple data browser

There is also a webapp version of the data browser online: See
 [data browser webapp live on github pages](https://solid.github.io/form-playground/playground.html)

That is good if you want to point some linked data on the web at it as a general viewer.
It will also generate you a view URI for its view of that object for you to link to or show to others.
